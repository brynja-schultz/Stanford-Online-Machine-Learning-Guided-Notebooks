# Stanford Online Machine Learning – Guided Notebooks

This repository contains **instructor-provided, guided Jupyter notebooks** from the Stanford Online Machine Learning course.
I executed, reviewed, and annotated each notebook to reinforce core concepts and ensure practical understanding.

## Structure

Notebooks are organized by **course module** and **week**:

* **C1\_W#** → Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning (Linear & Logistic Regression, Regularization)
* **C2\_W#** → Course 2: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
* **C3\_W#** → Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

Each notebook covers a focused concept, such as:

* Python & NumPy for ML
* Model representation and cost functions
* Gradient descent optimization
* Feature scaling & polynomial regression
* Classification & decision boundaries
* Regularization and overfitting control
* Neural network layers and activation functions
* TensorFlow model building
* Clustering and anomaly detection
* Recommendation systems
* Reinforcement learning basics

## Purpose

While the notebooks were authored by course instructors, I:

* Ran all cells and debugged any runtime issues
* Experimented with parameter changes to observe output variations

This repo serves as a **reference and learning log**, demonstrating structured engagement with high-quality, instructor-guided ML labs.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Common ML packages: NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Disclaimer

These notebooks are adapted from Stanford Online course materials.
They are for **educational use only** and are not original authored work.
